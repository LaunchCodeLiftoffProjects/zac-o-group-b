# Notes

To do and notes to self (Paige Kilcullen):

-Check how elements from the HTML file are being called, this has been an issue
-"is done" strikethrough not working, go through CSS and JS and check how items are being called

-Display function needs to be altered and checked for syntax errors to:
>include checkmark box
call strikethrough properly
~~trashcan icon should be turning red on hover, it is not.~~

other errors:

returning
>"script.js:27 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isDone')
at Grocery_List_Class.done_undone (script.js:27)
