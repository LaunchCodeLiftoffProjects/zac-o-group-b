# Notes

To do and notes to self (Paige Kilcullen):

-Check how elements from the HTML file are being called, this has been an issue
-"is done" strikethrough not working, go through CSS and JS and check how items are being called

-Display function needs to be altered and checked for syntax errors to:
>include empty checkmark box on left, change to gray checked box on hover, then change to black checked box once selected along with strikethrough
call strikethrough properly
~~trashcan icon should be turning red on hover, it is not.~~(spelling error)

other errors:

~~returning~~
>~~"script.js:27 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isDone')~~
~~at Grocery_List_Class.done_undone (script.js:27)~~
~~at HTMLLIElement.< anonymous> (script.js:62)"~~

~~when deleting objects from list on chrome~~
note: returning error because the property has been deleted, therefore cannot read a property that no longer exists. Not a true error.
