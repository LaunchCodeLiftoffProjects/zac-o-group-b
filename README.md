# Save Green
Save green is an app that lets the user create a shopping list, check items off when purchased, and set the use by date for any items that get stored in the fridge. Not only that but it lets the user create and store recipes as well. The next step of the project will be to make an alert system that checks the use by date of items and notifies the user when items are coming close to their expiration.
